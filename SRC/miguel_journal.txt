Positive moment: I woke up and was able to spend a little morning time with my children
Challenge handled: So far the homework was making my head hurt becuase I was unaware of how to do something, I did a little investigation and was able to complete the assignment.
Connections: I have a group chat with some family members and they were sharing images of the outside of their homes, they have snow, so instead of feeling left out I took a picture of the scaffolding on my building and giggled a bit.
Self-discovery: Its ok to laugh alone from time to time, at least you know you are alive
Looking forward: More time with my family.
Do differently: nothing really I am happy with the outcome so far.
Current feelings: Blessed
