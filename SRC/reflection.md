- Lets use this space for what is for and make sure we can work clean and efficiently.
- Submitted W8D1 initial document of our first ideal project for Capstone.
- I have created the repository that will allow us to work as a collaborative group and advance as needed.
- I have successfully linked VS Code from my direct system to our GitHub repository, I will be able to walk the rest of you through the process.
- I have added some information to the code. I have created a baseline to assist with our ideas and make changes as needed.
- Created README.md file so we can add project based responses, reflection.md file for the team to communicate and advise of any ideas or changes they are interested in implementing.

- @DeAnna thank you for the note I will make the changes and refresh. So I don't mess this up, the file name journal_companion.py should be src/app.py. rules.py should match to which command?
- Now that I understand I will adjust.

## DeAnna

- Submitted W8D2 project for the team with indication of the new project for our Capstone.
- Created the proper documents to ensure that we all remain on task.
- Created a Google docs that is accessible by the entire team.
- I have updated the README with the other required sections: Team members, Responsible AI, User Instructions and placeholders for Prompt Library (Roland) and Featured Spec (currently assignned to MW but I will assist as needed)
  
 @Miguel assignment W9D1 states we have to use the specific file names src/app.py and rules.py. We currently have it listed as python journal_companion.py
