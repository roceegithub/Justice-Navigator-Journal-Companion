## Purpose

- This project is a Journal Companion that will help the user in his everyday life. Originally the thought process was directed towards reentry to society for previously incarcaerated individuals, after careful consideration we have decided that it would be benefitial to all individuals that lack a community.
- The goal is to be able to uplift and assist with positive thinking and build with some self help guidance.
- The Journal is meant to have a personal encounter that could help in moments of need but as well to track your everyday feelings and provide words of encouragement.

## Setup

- Clone the Repository
- Install Python 3.10+
- (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment
- Requirements TBA

## How to run

- Once the system is setup the key will be python journal_companion.py and run on your terminal.
- System will introduce the developers and provide a header designated the name of the file.
- We would prefer your name as the system is created with the user in mind as to personalize the experience, but it is up to the user to decide which name it would like the system to refer to him as.

## Usage Instructions for user

- Run the CLI using python3 src/app.py.
- Select your mood when prompted.
- The tool will return a reflection prompt based on tone and safety rules.

## Responsible AI Use

- AI is a tool, not a source of truth. Users must verify outputs.
- No sensitive or identifying data should be entered into prompts.
- This journal companion is not a crisis or therapeutic tool.
- AI responses may be incomplete or biased; safe defaults are used.
- The tool does not provide medical, legal, or mental health advice.
- AI was used to help structure initial drafts. All final content was authored, reviewed, and revised by the team.
